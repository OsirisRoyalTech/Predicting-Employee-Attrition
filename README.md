# Predicting Employee Attrition
In this project, we will predict employee attrition (employee turnover) in a company based on various features such as age, job satisfaction, salary, years at the company, and other relevant details. High employee attrition can result in significant costs for companies, and by predicting it, companies can take proactive steps to retain their employees.

# Objective
We aim to predict whether an employee will leave the company (attrition) based on multiple factors. This is a binary classification problem, where we will use machine learning models to predict whether an employee will leave or stay.

# Steps for the Project
1.	Data Collection: We'll use the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from here:         https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset
2.	Data Preprocessing: We will clean the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the features and target variable for modeling.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will visualize and understand the relationship between features and the target variable (attrition).
4.	Model Building: We will apply classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost to predict employee attrition.
5.	Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the models using performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to determine which model performs best.
