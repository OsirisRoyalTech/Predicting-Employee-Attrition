Based on the classification reports, we can compare the models on various metrics:
•	Accuracy: The overall correctness of the model.
•	Precision: How many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive.
•	Recall: How many of the actual positive instances were correctly predicted.
•	F1-Score: A balanced measure between precision and recall.
