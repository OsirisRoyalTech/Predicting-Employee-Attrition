In this project, we predicted employee attrition using machine learning. The steps involved:
•	Data collection and preprocessing.
•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships.
•	Model building using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
•	Model evaluation using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
